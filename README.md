#Pig Dice Game 🐖

Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.

###Gameplay

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

+ The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
+ If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing, all his round score is lost and it becomes the next player's turn.
+ If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
+ If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
